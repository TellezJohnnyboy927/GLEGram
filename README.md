## Build

### Requirements
- macOS 15.7+
- Xcode 26.2+
- JDK 21 (for Bazel)
- Bazel 8.4.2

### Setup

1. Get Telegram API credentials at https://my.telegram.org/apps

2. Create build configuration:
   ```bash
   cp build-system/ipa-build-configuration.json build-system/my-build-configuration.json
   # Edit my-build-configuration.json with your API ID, API Hash, Team ID, Bundle ID
   ```

3. Set up code signing:
   ```bash
   # Place your .mobileprovision files in build-system/real-codesigning/profiles/
   # Place your .p12 certificate in build-system/real-codesigning/certs/
   ```

4. Build:
   ```bash
   # Production IPA (device)
   ./scripts/buildprod.sh

   # With custom build number
   ./scripts/buildprod.sh --buildNumber 100006

   # Clean build
   ./scripts/buildprod.sh --clean
   ```

### Known Issues
- Bazel 8.4.2 with embedded JDK 24 may crash on macOS 15.7.4+. The build system auto-applies `--server_javabase` with system JDK 21.
- First build takes ~15 minutes (opus, webrtc compilation). Subsequent builds use disk cache.
